/**
 * A filter is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to
 * a resource (a servlet or static container), or on the response from a resource,
 * or both.
 * 
 * Filters perform filtering in the <code>doFilter</code> method. Every Filter has access to 
 * a FilterConfig object from which it can obtain its initialization parameters, a reference
 * to the ServletContext which it can use, for example, to load resources needed for
 * filtering tasks.
 * 
 * Filter can configured in the deployment descriptor of a web application.
